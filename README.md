# Coadapt_CA
The Knowledge Base (KB) system is a HTTP-based REST API that provides access to the pre-trained topic model. KB implmentation is part of CO-ADAPT project. We hope the KB can be useful, adapted for implentation of conversational agent or electronic medical records analysis system to help therapists with symptom recommendations.
